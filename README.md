# DeckSurf Documentation

This repository is used for the [DeckSurf](https://deck.surf) project documentation. You don't need to inconvenience yourself with parsing the Markdown and YAML files here, and instead can use the [documentation site](https://docs.deck.surf). However, do use this repository if you want to contribute to the content!
