# February 2025 Regular Cadence Update

Release version: `0.0.6`

Release date: `02/17/2025`

## Changelog

This release introduces support for the following Stream Deck models: **MK.2**, **Neo**, **Mini**, and the **Original**. This means that starting with this release, all of the existing Stream Deck devices (with the exception of the [super-expensive rackable one](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-studio)) are now supported by DeckSurf.

I've also simplified the process for setting key images - you no longer need to resize the image before passing it into the key, as it's done automatically. This is part of an effort to improve the ergonomics of using the SDK.

## Installing package

You can see the package [on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DeckSurf.SDK/).

```powershell
Install-Package DeckSurf.SDK -Version 0.0.6
```
