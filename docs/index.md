# DeckSurf - Open Stream Deck SDK & Tooling

[DeckSurf](https://deck.surf) is an open-source project designed to make it easy to do whatever you want with a Stream Deck device. Keep in mind that this is **not the official SDK** - if you want to build plugins for the official Stream Deck software, you need to use the [Elgato tooling](https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/overview/).

## Repositories

If you are curious about exploring the tooling that is available, start with the public GitHub repositories:

- **[CLI & Base Plugins](https://github.com/dend/decksurf).** Use this for experimentation with the Stream Deck and all the basic tools - you don't need to develop anything, and can just manage the device.
- **[Software Development Kit](https://github.com/dend/decksurf-sdk).** If you want to build something that leverages the Stream Deck, you can use the SDK from this repository, or you can download the package [from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DeckSurf.SDK).
- **[Documentation](https://github.com/dend/decksurf-docs).** This repository contains everything that you see here (on the documentation site). Go there if you want to open an issue or contribute to the content.
